# E04a-Sprites Exercise


Hey guys, welcome to E04a-Sprites Exercise, in this assignment, I made some sprtites as instructors told us to do.
In the main1.py, I made the sprites showed randomly in the arcade and they are all located in different locations.
In main2.py, I made another sprites stand next to the orignial one, so they can talk together.
In main3.py, I changed some settings of the orignal file so that the sprites can move when the mouse is moving.
For extra credit, I used the same idea as main1.py, they would be different poses display on the screen.
